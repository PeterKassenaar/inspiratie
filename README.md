## BACKEND / MICROSERVICES
- cd to `\code\microservice` and run `npm install`.
- then run `npm start` to start the microservice.
- See if it works to enter an adress, for instance `http://localhost:3000/distance/10001/90001`.
- study the code in `..\microservice` to see how they connect (`server.js`, `routes.js` and so on)

## FRONTEND:
- cd to `\code\frontend` and run `npm install`.
- then run `npm start` to start the frontend.
- See if it works to enter some valid zipcodes in the input boxes.
